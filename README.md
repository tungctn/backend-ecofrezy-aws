# JunctionXHanoi 2023 Hackathon Project: EcoFrenzy

EcoFrenzy is a sustainable social media platform that aims to inspire and motivate users to take eco-friendly actions in their everyday lives. Our platform was developed during the JunctionXHanoi 2023 Hackathon, where our team focused on creating a solution that promotes sustainability across various aspects of life.

Our challenges are designed to be both green and fun, encouraging users to engage in eco-friendly activities and habits. Users can complete challenges assigned by the app or create their own and challenge their friends. The challenges range from reducing plastic waste to conserving water and energy. Once a challenge is completed, users can share it with their friends and receive points to compete with peers in a game of becoming the greenest one.

- **Points system**: Earn points for completing challenges and compete with friends to see who can complete the most and earn the most points.
